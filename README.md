# Revaria Lexicon
Revaria Lexicon is a reimplementation of the basic feature set of the Fantasia Archive worldbuilding sofware with a command line interface. Its original intent was to show an example implementation that allows for custom categories and fields to be added to a project on the fly, even while documents currently exist. Future plans include other community requested features, such as a complex-relationship field type, wherein a field can reference only documents referenced by another field that it relates to.

## Current functionality
RL Currently supports the following functionality:
* Simple, One way, and Two way relationships in fields
* Notes in relationship fields
* Custom categories and custom fields within those categories
  * Field deletion within categories
* Document creation, editing, and viewing

## Planned functionality
* Complex fields
* Project saving
* Default preset of categories and fields

## Unplanned, long term goals
* Graphical user interface implementation
